          <p>Hey, looks like this is my 1st blog post heh</p>
          <p>I honestly don't know what I'm gonna put on here, maybe when I go out like for TwitchCon for example, or even just meeting friends!
          </p>
          <p>Also this website is very laggy (currently on Neocities) so I might change for something else.</p>
          <p>And sometimes (like in every page) you can find some secret code, like "Text Decoration or of "You're here" element has been changed to underline", which you'll find in every page, because my brain can't figure out to change it in CSS, it just doesn't work for some reason...</p>

  <script>
    function colorHere(){
        var hereElm = document.getElementById("here");
        hereElm.style.textDecoration = "underline";
        console.log('Text Decoration or of "You\'re here" element has been changed to underline')
    }
    window.onload = colorHere;</script>
