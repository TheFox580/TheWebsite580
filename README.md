2025 Update :
I have Web lessons in Uni, so I'm gonna listen to try and make this a good looking website!

This is just a classic website I built to pass time and show off what I've made

It's honestly really bad, but honestly, I'll update it whenever I feel like it, and when i'll remember it exists.

It's currently hosted on [~~Neocities~~](https://thefox580.neocities.org) [Vercel](https://thewebsite580.vercel.app) but I'll change it whenever I can and want to, I just need to find a good host plan.
