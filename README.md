This is just a classic website I built to pass time and show off what I've made

It's honestly really bad, but honestly, I'll update it whenever I feel like it, and when i'll remember it exists.

It's currently hosted on [Neocities](https://thefox580.neocities.org) but I'll change it whenever I can and want to, I just need to find a good host plan.
