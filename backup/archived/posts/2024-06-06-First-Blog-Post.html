          <p>Hey, looks like this is my 1st blog post heh</p>
          <p>
            I honestly don't know what I'm gonna put on here, maybe when I go
            out like for TwitchCon for example, or even just meeting friends!
          </p>
          <p>
            Also this website is very laggy (currently on Neocities) so I might
            change for something else.
          </p>
          <p>
            And sometimes (like in every page) you can find some secret code,
            like "Text Decoration or of "You're here" element has been changed
            to underline", which you'll find in every page, because my brain
            can't figure out to change it in CSS, it just doesn't work for some
            reason...
          </p>
          <p>
            UPDATES : I think I fucked up the CSS, but meh, i don't care enough
            to update it. | The website moved from
            <a href="https://thefox580.neocities.org" target="”_blank”"
              >Neocities</a
            >
            to
            <a href="https://thewebsite580.vercel.app" target="”_blank”"
              >Vercel</a
            >, I don't know if i'll keep it there, but it's there for now! | It
            may allow me to use this website for projects like the Advancement
            Hunt solo version, which uses POST and GET, which are made with some
            JS code!
          </p>
          <p>
            BTW, you can find the <a>competitive</a> and <a>solo</a> pages by
            clicking on the gray words!
